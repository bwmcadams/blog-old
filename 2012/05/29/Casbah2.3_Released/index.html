<p>Today, I released the first Release Candidate of Casbah 2.3.0, available for SBT users as  <code>"org.mongodb" % "casbah" % "2.3.0-RC1"</code>. My <a href="http://notes.implicit.ly/post/24009446396/casbah-2-3-0rc1">release announcement</a> to <a href="http://implicit.ly">implicit.ly</a> contains the details on all of the bugs fixed – I will also be posting another set of blog entries shortly outlining the specific improvements to the code and demoing fetaures.</p>

<p>It has been just about a year since the last major release of Casbah, which was version <strong>2.1.5-1</strong>.  A number of factors led to the delay in getting a major update out the door, for which I apologize.  Amongst other things I have spent much of the last year since Casbah's prior release on the road doing training, consulting and evangelization of MongoDB to users around the globe; I had less time for code among all these things than I expected!  Additionally, after releasing the <strong>2.1.x</strong> series of Casbah I embarked on what quickly morphed from Casbah <strong>2.2.0</strong> to <strong>3.0.0</strong> – a major refactoring and cleanup of 2+ years of API cruft and "I'm Gonna Learn Me Some Scala!" detritus.  In all the excitement to release a perfect release to end all releases, I did a poor job of making it easy to backport and maintain a compatibility series for <strong>2.x</strong> users – a harsh lesson in the importance of creating small, bite sized git commits that can be cherry picked.</p>

<h2>So What Happened to Casbah 3.0? And 2.2?</h2>

<p>Casbah <strong>2.2.x</strong> is dead – <strong>3.0.x</strong> is certainly not!  When the work following <strong>2.1.x</strong> was begun, I had published a number of early snapshots as Casbah <em>2.2.0-SNAPSHOT</em>.  During this development cycle I found a lot of the aforementioned detritus such as overloaded methods (Casbah was begun as a Scala 2.7.x project and I never fully moved its core APIs over to use named and default arguments - some of these are corrected in Casbah <strong>2.3.0</strong> but in the interest of backwards compatibility with prior releases of 2.x, not completely). As I worked on coding improvements around these things the API drifted further and further away from compatibility and I chose to kill off the <strong>2.2.x</strong> series, planning the next release of Casbah as <strong>3.0.0</strong>.  In addition to that, I intended Casbah <strong>3.0.0</strong> to coincide with MongoDB <strong>2.2.0</strong> which will have additional features such as the New Aggregation Framework.  As MongoDB 2.2 hasn't been released yet, it became clear I needed to provide an updated Casbah release with many of the improvements but without many of the API breakages introduced in <strong>3.0</strong> - including a vastly improved build of the Casbah Query DSL which has stronger type safety and compiler checks thanks to the inimitable <a href="http://twitter.com/jteigen">Jon-Anders Teigen</a>.</p>

<p>Casbah <strong>3.0</strong> is still very much alive and in development, with <strong>2.3.0</strong> representing a backporting of many of the changes and improvements from <strong>3.0</strong>.  Because of the abandonment of the original <strong>2.2</strong> development series, I felt it was saner to kill <strong>2.2.x</strong> dead and bring the backports into a <strong>2.3.x</strong> series. You can, if you wish, think of this as <em>Casbah 2.3 - The Search for Casbah 2.2</em> (The long rumored sequel to Spaceballs has been said to be called <em>Spaceballs 3: The Search for Spaceballs 2</em>).</p>

<p>I will continue to support and improve Casbah <strong>2.3.x</strong> moving forward as well as completing Casbah <strong>3.0</strong> (still intended to coincide with the release of MongoDB 2.2). If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me!</p>

<p><em>Later tonight or tomorrow I will post an entry or two detailing all of the wonderful changes in Casbah 2.3.0 and how to take advantage of them.</em></p>
