  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve been working on a rewrite of <a href="http://www.sluggy.com">Sluggy Freelance</a> - a friend&rsquo;s site which I&rsquo;ve worked on for about a decade now. Caching is a big part of keeping site cost down, and over the years I&rsquo;ve come to trust <a href="http://memcached.org">Memcached</a>. Fast, lightweight, and easy, Memcached has served me well over the years over several iterations of the site&hellip; from Perl, PHP, and Python.</p>

<p>Today, I&rsquo;m rewriting the site in <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org">Scala</a> with <a href="http://www.scalatra.org">Scalatra</a> and <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React.js</a>. As a result, I&rsquo;m discovering all sorts of new fun that I haven&rsquo;t dealt with in Scala yet. One of these is using Memcached, and specifically serialising/deserialising Case Classes. With the combination of a good Memcached library - <a href="http://github.com/alexandru/shade">shade</a>, in this case - and <a href="https://github.com/scala/pickling">Scala Pickling</a>*, I&rsquo;ve found a powerful combination.</p>

<p>So far, I&rsquo;m working with a datastructure representing navigation: the current book, chapter, and section as well as lists of others of those based on context. As a bonus&hellip; I&rsquo;m actually serialising case classes that are fetched from Slick.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently, as part of my role with the Professional Services team at <a href="http://typesafe.com">Typesafe</a>, I have been working on site at a customer who is using a lot of Akka and Play. During this time, I&rsquo;ve gotten a chance to solve some interesting problems and answer obscure questions&hellip; which for those who like chasing these kinds of puzzles issues (like myself) is a fantastic way to spend the day (<em>and if this kind of thing sounds exciting to you, we&rsquo;re aggressively hiring for <a href="http://blog.typesafe.com/send-akka-consultant-candidates-our-way-and-w">this kind of work</a> ;)</em> )</p>

<p>One item in particular came up recently as we tried to create a cron-style job to do interval data processing – big blocks of input data would be separated into individual instructions for processing, using <a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.0.5/">Akka 2.0.x</a>. The developer I was working with found that, among other things, using only a single actor to process all of their data items was not particularly performant. Further, once we solved this problem we couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to cleanly shut down Akka without interrupting any messages being processed. Fortunately, Akka offers simple answers to both of these problems&hellip; if you know where to look.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the last year or so, I have found myself making more and more use of Scala&rsquo;s Type Class system to add flexibility to my code.  This is especially evident in the MongoDB Scala Driver, <a href="Casbah">http://github.com/mongodb/casbah</a>, where the most recent work has been to simplify many features by migrating them to type classes.</p>

<p>During this work however, I&rsquo;ve found during that many otherwise adroit Scala engineers seem befuddled or daunted by the Type Class. It does me no good to take advantage of clever features that my users don&rsquo;t understand, and many will benefit from introducing these concepts to their own code. So let&rsquo;s take a look at what type classes are, as well as how &amp; why we can utilize them.</p>

<p>Wikipedia defines a Type Class as <em>&ldquo;&hellip; a type system construct that supports ad-hoc polymorphism. This is achieved by adding constraints to type variables in parametrically polymorphic types&rdquo;</em>. Admittedly, a bit of a mouthful &ndash; and not very helpful to those of us who are self taught and lack the benefit of a comprehensive academic Computer Science education (myself included). Surely, there must be a way to simplify this concept?</p>

<p>In evaluating these ideas, I&rsquo;ve found it easiest to think of a Type Class (in Scala, at least) as a special kind of <em>adapter</em>, which can impart additional capabilities upon a given type or set of types. In Scala the Type Class is communicated through <em>implicits</em>, and imparts one, or both, of two behaviors. First, a Type Class can be to utilized to <em>filter</em> what types are valid for a given method call (which I detailed in <a href="/2011/07/13/User_Configgable_Type_Filtering_with_Type_Classes/">this earlier post</a>). Second, a Type Class can impart additional features and behaviors upon a type at method invocation time. This latter is much along the lines of an enhanced kind of composition, rather than the weaker inheritance which often plagues similar behaviors in a language like Java.</p>

<p>To better understand what I am describing, let&rsquo;s compare a few concepts around the creation and interaction of custom domain objects. I have several sets of tasks I have had to accomplish in Scala in the past &ndash; and Scala solutions show some elegant Type Class oriented approaches which are rooted in the Standard Library. While this may seem a bit contrived, it is exactly the kind of problem through which <em>I</em> initially came to understand Type Classes –– and is thus an ideal lesson.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since early in its history, Casbah has had a helper method called <code>getAs[T]</code>, where <code>T</code> is &ldquo;Some type you&rsquo;d like to fetch a particular field as&rdquo;. Because of type erasure on the JVM, working with a Mongo Document can be annoying &ndash; the representation in Scala is the equivalent of a <code>Map[String, Any]</code>. If we were to work with the <code>Map[String, Any]</code> in a standard mode, fetching a field <em>balance</em> which is a <code>Double</code> would require manual casting.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala"><span class="k">val</span> <span class="n">doc</span><span class="k">:</span> <span class="kt">DBObject</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nc">MongoDBObject</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;foo&quot;</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="s">&quot;bar&quot;</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;balance&quot;</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="mf">2.5</span><span class="o">)</span>

<span class="k">val</span> <span class="n">balance</span> <span class="k">=</span> <span class="n">doc</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;balance&quot;</span><span class="o">)</span></code></pre></div>


<p>We have already hit another issue here &ndash; in Scala, invoking <code>get</code> on a <code>Map</code> returns <code>Option[T]</code> (Where, in this case, <code>T</code> is of type <code>Any</code>). Which means casting has become more complex: to get a <code>Double</code> we also have to unwrap the <code>Option[Any]</code> first. A lazy man&rsquo;s approach might be something hairy like so:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala"><span class="n">balance</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">getOrElse</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="kc">null</span><span class="o">).</span><span class="n">asInstanceOf</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="kt">Double</span><span class="o">]</span></code></pre></div>


<p>In the annals of history (when men were <em>real</em> men, and small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri were <em>real</em> small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri), the above became an annoyingly common pattern. A solution was needed - and so <code>getAs[T]</code> was born. The idea was not only to allow a shortcut to casting, but take care of the <code>Option[T]</code> wrapping for you as well. Invoking <code>getAs[Double]</code> will, in this case, return us an <code>Option[Double]</code>.</p>

<p>But not everything is perfect in the land of <code>getAs[T]</code> &ndash; if the type requested doesn&rsquo;t match the actual type, runtime failures occur. Worse, if the user fails to pass a type, the Scala compiler substitutes <code>Nothing</code>, which <em>guarantees</em> a runtime failure. Runtime failures are bad &ndash; but fortunately, <a href="http://twitter.com/milessabin">Miles Sabin</a> &amp; <a href="http://twitter.com/jteigen">Jon-Anders Teigen</a> came up with an awesome solution.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today, I published the first Release Candidate of Casbah 2.3.0, available for SBT users as  <code>"org.mongodb" % "casbah" % "2.3.0-RC1"</code>. My <a href="http://notes.implicit.ly/post/24009446396/casbah-2-3-0rc1">release announcement</a> to <a href="http://implicit.ly">implicit.ly</a> contains the details on all of the bugs fixed – I will also be posting another set of blog entries shortly outlining the specific improvements to the code and demoing fetaures.</p>

<p>It has been just about a year since the last major release of Casbah, which was version <strong>2.1.5-1</strong>.  A number of factors led to the delay in getting a major update out the door, for which I apologize.  Amongst other things I have spent much of the last year since Casbah&rsquo;s prior release on the road doing training, consulting and evangelization of MongoDB to users around the globe; I had less time for code among all these things than I expected!  Additionally, after releasing the <strong>2.1.x</strong> series of Casbah I embarked on what quickly morphed from Casbah <strong>2.2.0</strong> to <strong>3.0.0</strong> – a major refactoring and cleanup of 2+ years of API cruft and &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Gonna Learn Me Some Scala!&rdquo; detritus.  In all the excitement to release a perfect release to end all releases, I did a poor job of making it easy to backport and maintain a compatibility series for <strong>2.x</strong> users – a harsh lesson in the importance of creating small, bite sized git commits that can be cherry picked.</p>

<h2>So What Happened to Casbah 3.0? And 2.2?</h2>

<p>Casbah <strong>2.2.x</strong> is dead – <strong>3.0.x</strong> is certainly not!  When the work following <strong>2.1.x</strong> was begun, I had published a number of early snapshots as Casbah <em>2.2.0-SNAPSHOT</em>.  During this development cycle I found a lot of the aforementioned detritus such as overloaded methods (Casbah was begun as a Scala 2.7.x project and I never fully moved its core APIs over to use named and default arguments - some of these are corrected in Casbah <strong>2.3.0</strong> but in the interest of backwards compatibility with prior releases of 2.x, not completely). As I worked on coding improvements around these things the API drifted further and further away from compatibility and I chose to kill off the <strong>2.2.x</strong> series, planning the next release of Casbah as <strong>3.0.0</strong>.  In addition to that, I intended Casbah <strong>3.0.0</strong> to coincide with MongoDB <strong>2.2.0</strong> which will have additional features such as the New Aggregation Framework.  As MongoDB 2.2 hasn&rsquo;t been released yet, it became clear I needed to provide an updated Casbah release with many of the improvements but without many of the API breakages introduced in <strong>3.0</strong> - including a vastly improved build of the Casbah Query DSL which has stronger type safety and compiler checks thanks to the inimitable <a href="http://twitter.com/jteigen">Jon-Anders Teigen</a>.</p>

<p>Casbah <strong>3.0</strong> is still very much alive and in development, with <strong>2.3.0</strong> representing a backporting of many of the changes and improvements from <strong>3.0</strong>.  Because of the abandonment of the original <strong>2.2</strong> development series, I felt it was saner to kill <strong>2.2.x</strong> dead and bring the backports into a <strong>2.3.x</strong> series. You can, if you wish, think of this as <em>Casbah 2.3 - The Search for Casbah 2.2</em> (The long rumored sequel to Spaceballs has been said to be called <em>Spaceballs 3: The Search for Spaceballs 2</em>).</p>

<p>I will continue to support and improve Casbah <strong>2.3.x</strong> moving forward as well as completing Casbah <strong>3.0</strong> (still intended to coincide with the release of MongoDB 2.2). If you have any questions, please don&rsquo;t hesitate to contact me!</p>

<p><em>Later tonight or tomorrow I will post an entry or two detailing all of the wonderful changes in Casbah 2.3.0 and how to take advantage of them.</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night, I found myself unconciously refactoring some Scala code (I don&rsquo;t recall if it was something I wrote or someone else did at this point). As I looked at what I was doing I realized that many Scala developers don&rsquo;t seem entirely aware of one of my favorite features.  What I&rsquo;m talking about is effectively capturing values from multibranch block statements in Scala.  Used correctly they can greatly decruft complicated code as well as helping us use mutability in places we might not expect an easy way to do so.</p>

<p>In typical C-like languages (such as C, C++, and Java) we are restricted in our syntax should we wish to capture a value when running many branching blocks such as if-else statements, switch statements and even for/foreach constructs. When we find ourselves wanting to set the value of a variable within each possible condition or iteration, we need to declare a mutable variable before the block.  We then mutate this variable within each condition or iteration.  Take this example from Java:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="kt">boolean</span> <span class="n">valid</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kc">false</span><span class="o">;</span>

<span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">status</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kc">null</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">valid</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="n">status</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;VALIDATED&quot;</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="o">}</span> 
<span class="k">else</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="n">status</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;INVALID&quot;</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I woke up this morning and looked through my twitter mentions, I found this gem sitting there from the middle of the night:</p>

<p><img src="/images/oid_lt_casbah.png" alt="@rit when using &quot;_id&quot; $lt new ObjectId(timestamp) it throws ValidDateOrNumericType, but we might want to select records after id timestamp (from @justthor)" /></p>

<p>The user in question is complaining that when using <a href="http://github.com/mongodb/casbah">Casbah&rsquo;s DSL</a>, it doesn&rsquo;t allow a MongoDB <code>ObjectId</code> as a valid type to the <code>$lt</code> operator.  But as <a href="http://twitter.com/justthor">@justthor</a> points out, it is entirely possible to use <code>ObjectId</code> with the <code>$lt</code> operator since it contains timestamp information (See the <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Object+IDs">documentation for ObjectId</a> if you want nitty gritty detail).   When I wrote the code for <code>$lt</code> however, I needed to decide what types were valid and weren&rsquo;t valid; I can&rsquo;t exactly guarantee type safety wih a DSL like Casbah&rsquo;s, but I can enforce type <em>sanity</em>.  Whether I forgot that you can use <code>ObjectId</code> in <code>$lt</code> or just decided that most people wouldn&rsquo;t need to is irrelevant &mdash; I had in this case blocked a user from accomplishing something valid that they needed to.</p>

<p>It is a more than reasonable problem, and my initial reaction was &ldquo;oh crap, I guess I need to patch that&rdquo;.  But what I forgot is that a few releases back, I rearchitected Casbah to obviate this kind of problem.  Casbah now allows for a user definable (or, if you prefer, &ldquo;adjustable&rdquo;) type filter on any of its DSL operators.  This is accomplished through a very simple application of Scala Type Classes, a term which gets batted around a lot in the Scala community, but few seem able to understand or articulate its meaning to us lesser mortals.  Over the last few months I&rsquo;ve come to understand Type Classes much more deeply than I think I ever expected, and applied these lessons to the design of my code.  As I failed to document the power and usage of these features at the time, I am going to be writing some additional detailed articles about <em>my</em> understanding of Type Classes in the next few weeks, and this is the first of such explanations.</p>

<p>So the question at hand is, how exactly does Casbah allow us to do this magical type filtering that I just mentioned, without patching the driver or creating a new release?  First, let&rsquo;s look at how Casbah used to do things before the introduction of the as-yet unexplained Type Class introduction.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my <a href="http://blog.evilmonkeylabs.com/2011/01/27/MongoDB-1_8-MapReduce/">last post</a>, I introduced the
new MapReduce features introduced in MongoDB 1.8, which is now <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/1.8+Release+Notes">available as a release candidate</a>.  Most importantly the temporary collection system has gone away, now requiring that you specify an output parameter.  With that required output comes new options for how to create incremental output using the <em>merge</em> and <em>reduce</em> output modes.</p>

<p>As I write this, we are prepping new releases of our <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Java+Language+Center">Java Driver</a> (v2.5) and our <a href="http://api.mongodb.org/scala/casbah">Scala Driver, Casbah</a> (v2.1) which are intended to support MongoDB 1.8&rsquo;s new features including incremental MapReduce.  Since I implemented the APIs for the new MapReduce output in both drivers, I thought I&rsquo;d demonstrate the application of these new output features to the previous dataset.  This post is focused on the Java API, but a Scala one will likely follow.</p>

<p>As a reminder (or a primer for those who skipped my <a href="http://blog.evilmonkeylabs.com/2011/01/27/MongoDB-1_8-MapReduce/">last post</a>), I&rsquo;ve been testing the 1.8 MapReduce using a dataset and MapReduce job originally created to test the <a href="http://github.com/mongodb/mongo-hadoop">MongoDB+Hadoop Plugin</a>.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>MongoDB 1.7.5 shipped yesterday, and is expected to be the last &lsquo;beta&rsquo; release of what will become MongoDB 1.8.  As part of the release, I&rsquo;ve been doing testing of the new MapReduce functionality and thought this a good time to highlight those changes for people.</p>

<p>If you aren&rsquo;t new to MongoDB MapReduce, the most important thing to note since MongoDB 1.6.x is that temporary collections are gone; it is now <em>required</em> to specify an output.  Previously, if you omitted the <em>out</em> argument MongoDB would create a temporary collection and return its name with the job results; In non-sharded MongoDB setups these temporary collections would go out of scope and be cleaned up when the connection closed.  Unfortunately, for sharded setups it wasn&rsquo;t possible to safely clean these up–&ndash;they would remain behind and clutter up the database.  For this and other reasons the temporary collection feature was removed. There is good news though: they&rsquo;ve been replaced with an even better system for saving the results of MapReduce jobs!</p>

<p>While the <em>out</em> argument is now a required parameter in MapReduce jobs, it has a number of options for controlling what MongoDB does with results.  If you&rsquo;re running a truly one-off job where you don&rsquo;t need to keep the results later, MongoDB now supports returning results &ldquo;inline&rdquo;.  Be careful here though: your results are being returned in a single document and are subject to the document size limitations of MongoDB (16MB per document in 1.8).  To use inline results, set the value of <em>out</em> to a document <code>{inline: 1}</code>.  The result object will contain an additional key <em>results</em> which contains the MapReduce output; the <em>result</em> field will be omitted.</p>

<p>As with previous versions of MongoDB, you can specify a collection name (as a string) in the <em>out</em> argument.  If the named collection already exists MongoDB will replace it entirely with the MapReduce results. Along with the inline mode, MongoDB 1.8 introduces support for &ldquo;merge&rdquo; and &ldquo;reduce&rdquo; output modes; instead of replacing the target collection MongoDB can be instructed to reconcile the MapReduce results with the existing data.  To use these modes, set the value of <em>out</em> to a document with a key of either &ldquo;merge&rdquo; or &ldquo;reduce&rdquo; and a value of the collection to save to.</p>

<p>The difference in &ldquo;merge&rdquo; and &ldquo;reduce&rdquo; has to do with MongoDB does when it encounters duplicate keys in both the existing collection and the MapReduce results.  In &ldquo;merge&rdquo; mode, MongoDB will simply overwrite the existing key with the new one from the MapReduce output.  In &ldquo;reduce&rdquo; mode, MongoDB will run the reduce function again with both the new and old data, saving those results to the collection (you remembered to make your reduce function idempotent, right?). <strong>UPDATE</strong>: If you specified a &ldquo;finalize&rdquo; function, MongoDB will re-run this after the &ldquo;reduce&rdquo; runs.</p>

<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve thoroughly confused you, lets dig into examples of each of these behaviors.  I&rsquo;ve been testing the 1.8 MapReduce using a dataset and MapReduce job originally created to test the <a href="http://github.com/mongodb/mongo-hadoop">MongoDB+Hadoop Plugin</a>.  It consists of daily U.S. Treasury Yield Data for about 20 years; the MapReduce task calculates an annual average for each year in the collection.  You can grab a copy of the entire collection in a handy mongoimport friendly <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-hadoop/raw/master/examples/treasury_yield/resources/yield_historical_in.json">datadump from the MongoDB+Hadoop repo</a>; here&rsquo;s a quick snippet of it:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>2010 proved to be a great year for growth and adoption of many fledgling technologies&mdash;not least among them, <a href="http://mongodb.org/" title="MongoDB">MongoDB</a> and <a href="http://scala-lang.org">Scala</a>.  Scala is designed as an alternative language for the Java platform, with a focus on scalability. It merges many of the Object Oriented concepts of languages like Java and C++ with the functional tools of Erlang, Haskell and Lisp with a bit of the dynamic natures of modern languages like Ruby and Python.  This flexible nature has sped Scala&rsquo;s adoption in the technology stacks of platforms like <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/node/7806">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="http://www.artima.com/scalazine/articles/twitter_on_scala.html">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.10gen.com/video/misc/foursquare">FourSquare</a> and many more.  By running on the JVM Scala has a strong affinity for working alongside existing Java applications, which allows users to build on their existing technology investments.</p>

<p>For 2011, MongoDB has added official support for Scala with the release of <a href="http://api.mongodb.org/scala/casbah/latest/">Casbah</a>, a Scala driver for MongoDB.  Casbah is built around the existing MongoDB Java Driver to give it a strong foundation, but designed to take advantage of many of the idioms of Scala such as a strong collections library, fluid syntax for building DSLs and functional concepts like closures and currying.</p>

<p>Because it is designed to be easy to work with for Scala users, Casbah introduces a more &lsquo;friendly&rsquo; syntax for creating MongoDB Objects, using Scala&rsquo;s Map syntax:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala"><span class="k">import</span> <span class="nn">com.mongodb.casbah.Imports._</span>
