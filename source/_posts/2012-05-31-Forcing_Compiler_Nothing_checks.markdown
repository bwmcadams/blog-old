Since early in its history, Casbah has had a helper method called `getAs[T]`, where `T` is "Some type you'd like to fetch a particular field as". Because of type erasure on the JVM, working with a Mongo Document can be annoying -- the representation in Scala is the equivalent of a `Map[String, Any]`. If we were to work with the `Map[String, Any]` in a standard mode, fetching a field *balance* which is a `Double` would require manual casting.

{% highlight scala %}
val doc: DBObject = MongoDBObject("foo" -> "bar", "balance" -> 2.5)

val balance = doc.get("balance") 
{% endhighlight %}

We have already hit another issue here -- in Scala, invoking `get` on a `Map` returns `Option[T]` (Where, in this case, `T` is of type `Any`). Which means casting has become more complex: to get a `Double` we also have to unwrap the `Option[Any]` first. A lazy man's approach might be something hairy like so:

{% highlight scala %}
balance.getOrElse(null).asInstanceOf[Double]
{% endhighlight %}

In the annals of history (when men were *real* men, and small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri were *real* small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri), the above became an annoyingly common pattern. A solution was needed - and so `getAs[T]` was born. The idea was not only to allow a shortcut to casting, but take care of the `Option[T]` wrapping for you as well. Invoking `getAs[Double]` will, in this case, return us an `Option[Double]`. 


But not everything is perfect in the land of `getAs[T]` -- if the type requested doesn't match the actual type, runtime failures occur. Worse, if the user fails to pass a type, the Scala compiler substitutes `Nothing`, which *guarantees* a runtime failure. Runtime failures are bad -- but fortunately, [Miles Sabin](http://twitter.com/milessabin) & [Jon-Anders Teigen](http://twitter.com/jteigen) came up with an awesome solution.

{% highlight scala %}
doc.getAs[String]("foo")
/* res1: Option[String] = Some(bar) */'
doc.getAs[Double]("balance")
/* res2: Option[Double] = Some(2.5) */
doc.getAs("balance")
/* res3: Option[Nothing] = Some(2.5) */

/* Notably at least, the Scala compiler is smart enough to infer "A" from the left-hand side *if* 
   an explicit type is declared */ 
val bal: Option[Double] = getAs(doc, "balance")
/* bal: Option[Double] = Some(2.5) */

{% endhighlight %}

We get back an option of `Nothing`, which is less than ideal (The REPL appears to be somewhat more forgiving in some of this behavior than the actual runtime is). My reaction to this early on was quite strong –– I wanted to *require* that the user pass their type argument. Unfortunately, the best I could do within Casbah was attempt to detect the compiler substituted `Nothing` and warn the user at runtime. Less than ideal, I know.

{% highlight scala %}
def getAs[A <: Any: Manifest](key: String): Option[A] = {
  require(manifest[A] != manifest[scala.Nothing],
    "Type inference failed; getAs[A]() requires an explicit type argument " +
    "(e.g. dbObject.getAs[<ReturnType>](\"somegetAKey\") ) to function correctly.")

  underlying.get(key) match {
    case null => None
    case value => Some(value.asInstanceOf[A])
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

This gave me somewhat improved behavior –- at least users are warned at runtime before something breaks.

{% highlight scala %}
doc.getAs("balance")
/* 
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: requirement failed: Type inference failed; getAs[A]() requires an explicit type argument (e.g. dbObject.getAs[<ReturnType>]("somegetAKey") ) to function correctly.
*/
{% endhighlight %}

Great -- we prevent people from utterly failing to pass a type to `getAs` by throwing an exception at runtime. A bit like closing the barn doors after the horses escaped, and somewhat counter to the point of compiled languages. Fortunately, Miles Sabin knows a lot of great compiler tricks and Jon-Anders has superpowers (which he uses for good, not evil). Using some of Miles' tricks, Jon-Anders has fixed Casbah (as of 2.3.0+) to make `getAs[T]` fail utterly at *compile time* when no type is passed.

The secret to this trick is essentially that the Scala compiler *hates* ambiguity. In order to substitute `Nothing` as a type argument when one isn't supplied, the Scala compiler has an implicit for `Nothing` scoped. If one were to exacerbate the situation by introducing an additional implicit for `Nothing`, the compiler would fail when no type argument is passed. 

With this in mind, we can morph `getAs` to work with a type class instead of a standard type argument. 

{% highlight scala %}
def getAs[A : NotNothing](key: String): Option[A] = {
  underlying.get(key) match {
    case null => None
    case value => Some(value.asInstanceOf[A])
  }
}

sealed trait NotNothing[A]{
  type B
}
{% endhighlight %}

Our previous unbounded type argument is replaced with the new type class boundary of `NotNothing` and the runtime `Nothing` check is removed. We also need concrete instances of our type class, which is where the real magic comes into play.

{% highlight scala %}
object NotNothing {
  implicit val nothing = new NotNothing[Nothing]{ type B = Any }
  implicit def notNothing[A] = new NotNothing[A]{ type B = A }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now, any application of `Nothing` will trigger the ambiguity problem -- the Scala compiler won't figure out how to resolve the type argument. This trick works because `Nothing` is at the *bottom* of Scala's type hierarchy. Were I to call `getAs("balance")`, the Scala compiler would attempt to fill in `Nothing` as the type argument. However, both implicit conversons for `nothing` *and* `notNothing[A]` will match -- causing ambiguity and compilation fails.

{% highlight scala %}
doc.getAs[String]("foo")
/* res0: Option[String] = Some(bar) */
doc.getAs[Double]("balance")
/* res1: Option[Double] = Some(2.5) */
doc.getAs("balance")
/* error: ambiguous implicit values:
 both value nothing in object NotNothing of type => java.lang.Object with com.mongodb.casbah.commons.NotNothing[Nothing]{type B = Any}
 and method notNothing in object NotNothing of type [A]=> java.lang.Object with com.mongodb.casbah.commons.NotNothing[A]{type B = A}
 match expected type com.mongodb.casbah.commons.NotNothing[A]
              doc.getAs("balance") 
                       ^
*/
{% endhighlight %}

A vast improvement in behavior, especially if we use the [`@implicitNotFound` annotation](http://suereth.blogspot.com/2011/03/annotate-your-type-classes.html) to provide clear error messages.

The moral of the story -- knowing the ins and outs of the type system and compiler corners can do great things for improving the functionality of your code. Especially being aware that as smart as the Scala compiler is, there are limitations inherent in the runtime platform (the JVM, specifically type erasure) that can make our lives difficult if ignored.

## Update 

While reviewing a draft of this post, [Daniel Spiewak](http://twitter.com/djspiewak) noted one more issue with my code as it exists.  Namely, that we don't have a sane way of preventing users from *miscasting*.  That is to say, if I try to fetch "balance" as a `String`, this shouldn't be OK.

{% highlight scala %}
doc.getAs[String]("balance").getOrElse(null)
java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.Double cannot be cast to java.lang.String
{% endhighlight %}

Daniel rightly points out how bad a runtime `ClassCastException` is, and has proposed another fix which I'm incorporating.

{% highlight scala %}
def getAs[A : NotNothing : Manifest](key: String): Option[A] = {
  underlying.get(key) match {
    case null => None
    case value if manifest[A] >:> Manifest.classType(value.getClass) =>
      Some(value.asInstanceOf[A])
    case fail => 
      log.warn("Unable to cast '%s' as '%s'; please check your types.", Manifest.classType(fail.getClass), manifest[A])
      None
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now, when you ask for a type that doesn't match what the Document contains, you will receive `None` and a warning in your log such as `Unable to cast 'java.lang.Double' as 'java.lang.String'; please check your types.`.
